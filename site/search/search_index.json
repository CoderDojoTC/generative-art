These systems can protect either the whole computer, such as through an interactive login screen, or individual services, such as a FTP server. There are many methods for identifying and authenticating users, such as passwords, identification cards, smart cards, and biometric systems. Anti-virus software Computer programs that attempt to identify, thwart, and eliminate computer viruses and other malicious software (malware). Authentication Techniques can be used to ensure that communication end-points are who they say they are. Cyberbullying The use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. Wikipedia Page on Cyberbullying Cryptography Encryption Software used to protect the confidentiality of a message. Cryptographically secure ciphers are designed to make any practical attempt of breaking them infeasible. Symmetric-key ciphers are suitable for bulk encryption using shared keys, and public-key encryption using digital certificates can provide a practical solution for the problem of securely communicating when no key is shared in advance. Ethical Hacking Using the actions of criminals to gain unauthorized access to computer systems, applicaitons or data while having persmission to perform an authorized attempt.The main goal is to discover vulnerabilities that can be exploited, demonstrate how the access was gained and provide detailed instruction on how to fix the vulnerabilities. Every ethical hacking attempt has rules of engagement, which defines how an ethical hack would be laid out, what methodology will be used, the start and end dates, the milestones, the goals of the penetration test, the liabilities and responsibilities. Firewall Gatekeeper systems between networks that only allows traffic that matches defined rules. Firewalls often include detailed logging, and may include intrusion detection and intrusion prevention features. They are near-universal between company local area networks and the Internet, but can also be used internally to impose traffic rules between networks if network segmentation is configured. Explore Firewall Settings Keyloggers Malicious forms of software and hardware that can detect the input from a computer's keyboard and save it for retrieval later or send it to a server connected over the internet to steal data from the victim's computer. Used to steal sensitive information such as logins, passwords, credit cards and other forms of protected data. Hacking An individual with technical computer skills but often refers to individuals who use their skills to breach cybersecurity defenses. The term is often used inappropriately to refer to criminals who use these skills to perform illegal acts of computer theft. Hijacking A network security attack where the attacker takes control of computer systems, software and / or network communications. Home Network Security Home network security refers to the protection of a network that connects devices\u2014such as routers, computers, smartphones, and Wi-Fi-enabled baby monitors and cameras\u2014to each other and to the internet within a home. Honey pots Computers that are intentionally left vulnerable to attack by crackers. They can be used to catch crackers and to identify their techniques. Identity Theft Identity (ID) theft happens when someone steals your personal information to commit fraud. The identity thief may use your information to apply for credit, file taxes, or get medical services. These acts can damage your credit status, and cost you time and money to restore your good name. Intrusion-detection system Devices or software applications that monitor networks or systems for malicious activity or policy violations. Malware Malware, short for \u201cmalicious software,\u201d refers to any intrusive software developed by cybercriminals (often called \u201chackers\u201d) to steal data and damage or destroy computers and computer systems. Examples of common malware include viruses, worms, Trojan viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware. Recent malware attacks have exfiltrated data in mass amounts. Passwords Passwords are secrets, usually a word or a phrase, that must be used to gain access to something. Port scan A probe an IP address for open ports to identify accessible network services and applications. Phishing Phishing is an attempt by cybercriminals posing as legitimate institutions, usually via email, to obtain sensitive information from targeted individuals. Email Phishing Pharming Pharming is a way of directing internet users to a bogus website that mimics the appearance of a legitimate one, in order to obtain personal information such as passwords, account numbers, etc. Privacy Settings Ransomware Ransomware is a form of malware that uses encryption as part of the attack on a victim's computer. It does so by making the victim's information unusable by encrypting it so the user cannot access files, databases or applications. The criminal will then demand a form of payment, usually in bitcoin or a similar form of payment, to unlock, or decrypt, the computer. ROT-13 ROT-13 or sometimes written, ROT13, is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. For example, if the original text is the letter D, the ROT-13 cipher would be the letter Q. SSL - Secure Sockets Layer Spyware SPAM Two Factor Authentication Trojans Viruses WiFi Security Worms A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself form computer to computer. It can replicate itself without any help from a human and it does not need to attach itself to a computer program in order to cause damage to software, hardware or a computer network. zero-day Exploit A computer-software vulnerability either unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation or known and without a patch to correct it. Until the vulnerability is mitigated, hackers can exploit it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers or a network.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#computer-security-glossary-of-terms","text":"","title":"Computer Security Glossary of Terms"},{"location":"glossary/#access-authorization","text":"Restricts access to a computer to a group of users through the use of authentication systems.

Beginning Labs Beginning labs only require a web browser. Lab 1: What is my IP address? Each computer on the internet is assigned its own Internet Protocol Address. What is the address assigned to your computer? (Hint: use a search to find a service that tells you what your IP address is). Lab 2: What is your WiFi network name? Each computer that uses WiFi must connect to the network through a WiFi router that has a name? How can you find out what your WiFi network name is? (Hint: use a search service to find the instructions for your device: Chrome, Windows, Mac, iPad) Lab 3: Who provides your internet connection? Every IP address is managed by a company that connects this address to the internet. That company is called your Internet Services Provider . Here is a tool that will help you find your ISP: https://www.whoismyisp.org/ Lab 4: How fast is your internet connection? Look for a program that can test your connection speed. What is your download and upload speed? What other information can you find about the time it takes to send a short packet of information back and forth from the server (latency). Lab 5: What is your MAC address? For each network interface in your computer, there is a unique MAC address associated with it. This is called the Media Access Control (MAC) address. This number is permanently burned into each device when it is manufactured and it is guaranteed to be unique across the internet. You usually can find MAC addresses in the system settings, general information, or network settings/status of your device. Sometimes the MAC address is printed on a property tag or label so that your organization can track the device. Here are some instructions on finding the MAC address on your Windows or Mac: What's a MAC Address and how do I find it? Note that in this case \"MAC\" has nothing to do with the Apple Mac operating system! Advanced Labs To do these labs, you will need to access your computer's command shell or Terminal (on the Mac). If you are running ChromeOS your school may not have the ChromOS shell installed. Ping Test Lab Ping is a useful program that will help you see the time it takes your computer to communicate with a report computer. It is named after the way that submarines sent out sounds underwater to see what items were near it (sonar). You can use it to debug network problems. Search for how to use the \"ping\" program on your operating systems: How do I run ping on Windows 10\" How do I run ping on a Mac\" How to run a ping test in Chrome OS (requires ChromOS Shell crosh) Video - your school may not have crosh enabled. For example on the Mac use the Terminal and type \"ping -c 10 google.com\". This will measure the time to get from your computer to google.com with a \"count\" of 10. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 $ ping -c 10 google.com PING google.com ( 142 .250.191.142 ) : 56 data bytes 64 bytes from 142 .250.191.142: icmp_seq = 0 ttl = 50 time = 47 .229 ms 64 bytes from 142 .250.191.142: icmp_seq = 1 ttl = 50 time = 52 .301 ms 64 bytes from 142 .250.191.142: icmp_seq = 2 ttl = 50 time = 43 .634 ms 64 bytes from 142 .250.191.142: icmp_seq = 3 ttl = 50 time = 51 .289 ms 64 bytes from 142 .250.191.142: icmp_seq = 4 ttl = 50 time = 51 .612 ms 64 bytes from 142 .250.191.142: icmp_seq = 5 ttl = 50 time = 51 .738 ms 64 bytes from 142 .250.191.142: icmp_seq = 6 ttl = 50 time = 48 .213 ms 64 bytes from 142 .250.191.142: icmp_seq = 7 ttl = 50 time = 46 .793 ms 64 bytes from 142 .250.191.142: icmp_seq = 8 ttl = 50 time = 56 .455 ms 64 bytes from 142 .250.191.142: icmp_seq = 9 ttl = 50 time = 52 .937 ms --- google.com ping statistics --- 10 packets transmitted, 10 packets received, 0 .0% packet loss round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 43 .634/50.220/56.455/3.522 ms The last column in the list is the time it took to make a round trip in milliseconds.
