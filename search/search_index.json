The key is used to associate billing with the service. Many commercial text-to-image systems require the user to register with a credit card to get an API Key. Images generated are billed to a credit card each month. Content The information is conveyed by an image. For example, the mood, the message, or the story. Domain The subject matter or context of an image. For example, a landscape, a portrait, a still life, or an abstract image. Embedding A vector of scalar numbers used to map a word or phrase into the mathematical structure for comparison using distance measurements. Fine Tuning The process of adding a small additional output layer to an existing model to give specific results. For example, diagrams that need to conform to Optum 2022 color themes would need to fine-tune a basic model. Gender Bias The tendency of machine learning models to favor one gender or another for specific occupations or roles. For example, the BERT large langugae model generates an 83% chance that a \"nurse\" will be female, but Generative Adversarial Network A neural network architecture used for image generation that uses dueling neural networks to genrate and judge the quality of images. Also known as: GAN Perceptual loss A loss function used in image generation that measures the difference between two images in a way that is perceptually meaningful to humans. Generative Model A machine learning model used to generate images from text descriptions. HuggingFace The largest collection of machine learning models and tools to fine-tune these models. As of August 2022, HuggingFace has 28 image to text models. See HuggingFace Text to Image Models Image synthesis The process of creating a new image from a set of input images. Multi-model Models Models that convert one medium into another medium. For example text-to-image, image-to-text, speech-to-text, text-to-speech etc. Many of the models can be fine-tuned to generate other representations such as text-to-line-art or text-to-architecture-diagram. Texture synthesis The process of creating a texture from a set of input textures Neural Network A machine learning model composed of a large number of interconnected processing nodes, or neurons, that can learn to recognize patterns of input data. Text-to-image models almost all use deep neural networks that contain millions or billions of parameters. Max Tokens The maximum number of tokens used by a prompt. After this limit is reached the text is ignored. The max-tokens for standard language models such as BERT are usually 512 tokens. Larger models such as GPT-3 are 2K or 4K tokens. Style The style used to render an image. For example, a photo, a cartoon, a wireframe, a sketch, line art, a painter or a painting. Prompts that desire a specific style can add the suffix such as \"in the style of...\" Style Transfer The process of creating an image in the style of another style, artist, image or type of image. For example, \"A cat in a field in the style of Vincent Van Goh\" Stable Diffusion The most popular text-to-image model on HuggingFace. See HuggingFace Training Bias The training data used to train a machine learning model. This data can influence the results of the model. Prompt The descriptive text that is given to generate an image. Text to Image The process of generating images from a text description using large langauge models. Tokenization The way that descriptive text is converted into a sequence of numeric values. Small common words are usually a single token. Uncommon multi-syllable words are often many tokens.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary/#glossary-of-terms-for-text-to-image-project","text":"","title":"Glossary of Terms for Text to Image Project"},{"location":"glossary/#api-key","text":"A key that is assigned to a developer to use a specific programming interface.

Beginning Labs Beginning labs only require a web browser. Lab 1: What is my IP address? Each computer on the internet is assigned its own Internet Protocol Address. What is the address assigned to your computer? (Hint: use a search to find a service that tells you what your IP address is). Lab 2: What is your WiFi network name? Each computer that uses WiFi must connect to the network through a WiFi router that has a name? How can you find out what your WiFi network name is? (Hint: use a search service to find the instructions for your device: Chrome, Windows, Mac, iPad) Lab 3: Who provides your internet connection? Every IP address is managed by a company that connects this address to the internet. That company is called your Internet Services Provider . Here is a tool that will help you find your ISP: https://www.whoismyisp.org/ Lab 4: How fast is your internet connection? Look for a program that can test your connection speed. What is your download and upload speed? What other information can you find about the time it takes to send a short packet of information back and forth from the server (latency). Lab 5: What is your MAC address? For each network interface in your computer, there is a unique MAC address associated with it. This is called the Media Access Control (MAC) address. This number is permanently burned into each device when it is manufactured and it is guaranteed to be unique across the internet. You usually can find MAC addresses in the system settings, general information, or network settings/status of your device. Sometimes the MAC address is printed on a property tag or label so that your organization can track the device. Here are some instructions on finding the MAC address on your Windows or Mac: What's a MAC Address and how do I find it? Note that in this case \"MAC\" has nothing to do with the Apple Mac operating system! Advanced Labs To do these labs, you will need to access your computer's command shell or Terminal (on the Mac). If you are running ChromeOS your school may not have the ChromOS shell installed. Ping Test Lab Ping is a useful program that will help you see the time it takes your computer to communicate with a report computer. It is named after the way that submarines sent out sounds underwater to see what items were near it (sonar). You can use it to debug network problems.
