## About Dall-E 2
DALL·E 2 is a new AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language ( in English for now ).
### How do I get access to Dall-E 2?
Currently there is a waitlist. ([Sign up here](https://labs.openai.com/waitlist)). You will have to wait a few days before you get an invitation email. Once you do, you will be able to use just a browser to start working with Dall-E 2 to generate amazing scenes.
### What does Dall-E 2 learn?
DALL·E 2 has learned the relationship between images and the text used to describe them. It uses a process called “diffusion,” which starts with a pattern of random dots and gradually alters that pattern towards an image when it recognizes specific aspects of that image.
## How do I prompt Dall-E to generate images?
There are three general elements to a prompt: 
  1. The object, for e.g. "teddy bears" 
  2. The scene, for e.g. "shopping for groceries" 
  3. The style, for e.g. "as a pencil drawing", or "in a photorealistic style", or "in ancient egypt". 

By varying the words in the prompt, you can generate an infinite amount of art. Since Dall-E 2 has been trained with an enormous amount of "words, image" pairs, we really don't know what Dall-E really knows. The best way is to try different things, and learn from what others on the internet have learned by trying. 
### Prompt responsibly
The creators of Dall-E 2, OpenAI are trying hard to limit offensive language in the prompts as well as the images that are generated. However, we all need to use this powerful AI as responsibly as we can too. If you see offensive images being generated, you can flag them as such.
## Style Hints
Here are some styles that people have discovered: 
  - Output styles such as : 3D render, digital art,
  - emotions such as : cute, dynamic
  - color hint - such as "green desert" 
  - ... 
## Example Prompts
## Inpainting
Using the editor's eraser tool, you can ask Dall-E to "paint inside" the erased area using the prompt you provide. For example, say you upload a picture with your car in front of a mountain. You can erase a circular portion of the sky and prompt Dall-E to generate a moon or sun in that circle!
## Outpainting
Dall-E 2 will generate a scene in a 1024x1024 frame. Sometimes you want to _extend_ a scene. You can do this using a feature called _Outpainting_. Its really simple - you add a _generation frame_ using the editor to an edge of the image and ask Dall-E to "regnerate" a new image variation based on the original. Once you accept one of the few ( generally 4 ) variations, you can repeat this step to keep painting "outwards".
