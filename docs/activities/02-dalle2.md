## About Dall-E 2
DALL·E 2 is a new AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language ( in English for now ).
### How do I get access to Dall-E 2?
Currently there is a waitlist. [Sign up here]([url](https://labs.openai.com/waitlist)). You will have to wait a few days before you get an invitation email. Once you do, you will be able to use just a browser to start working with Dall-E 2 to generate amazing scenes.
### What does Dall-E 2 learn?
DALL·E 2 has learned the relationship between images and the text used to describe them. It uses a process called “diffusion,” which starts with a pattern of random dots and gradually alters that pattern towards an image when it recognizes specific aspects of that image.
