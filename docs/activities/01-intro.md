# Introduction to Cybersecurity Hands-On Activities

For most classrooms, just giving students a list of term with definitions like our [Glossary](../glossary) is not a good learning method.  Our goal is to create fun hands-on activities to get our students to have fun learning about information security.

Here are some sample activities we have created:

## The ROT13 Game

Get students to convert cleartext into encrypted text using a simple a simple letter substitution method. The activity is [here](02-rot13-game.md)

## Network Scavenger Hunt

In this game students have to find out things such as:

1. Their IP address
2. The name of their WiFi network
3. The name of their internet service provider
3. Their download performance

The beginning activities can usually be done using  just a web browser.  Some of the advanced exercises require using a command prompt.
