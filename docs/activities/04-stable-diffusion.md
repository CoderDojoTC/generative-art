# Stable Diffusion Lab

This lab is challenging since the render time on the HuggingFace site is around five minutes, so we will only perform a few tests.

## Girl at Computer

Prompt: An African girl having fun at her computer.

This prompt shows that Stable Diffusion does well at faces, but falls short when rendering hands.
