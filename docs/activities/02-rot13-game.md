# ROT13 Encryption Games

ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome.

To do this activity, take a word or phrase and convert it into ROT13.  You can use a table or an encryption wheel.  Then give the message to a friend and ask them if they can decrypt it back into the original cleartext.
