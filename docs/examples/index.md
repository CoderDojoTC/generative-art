# Examples of Images Generated by Text-to-Image Models
There are now millions of sample images created by text-to-image generation tools.  In this area we discuss some of these images classifications.

## Using Lexia
One of the best ways to get a feeling of what these tools is capable of is to use the [Lexia Sable Diffusion Search Engine](https://lexica.art/).  Once you find a single image that inspires you, you can click on that image, see the prompt, Seed, Guidance scale and Dimensions.  You can also:

1. Copy the prompt
2. Copy the URL
3. Expand the size of the similar images
4. Use this image as a basis for other search results using the "Explore This Style"

You will note that these images are not manually "tagged" with metadata for search results.  The search engine uses [embeddings](https://rom1504.medium.com/image-embeddings-ed1b194d113e) to find similar images.
