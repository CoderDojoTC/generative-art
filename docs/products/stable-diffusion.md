# Stable Diffusion

Stable diffusion is a small text-to-image model that runs on consumer-grade GPUs.

## Background
Stable Diffusion was created by Emad Mostaque of [stability.ai](http://stability.ai).  Emad was a former hedge fund manager that funded the initial development of stable diffusion.  The initial model was trained on a 1,000 node [A-100](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/) cluster.  The MSRP for each A-100 is $32,097.00 making the cluster value be around $32M.
